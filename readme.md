# The Project that I have to create a DataWare House From Raw Data
## Story
E-commerce Service Company A is one of the large e-commerce companies capable of providing international products to customers. Items shipped domestically need at least 14 days of inspection before shipping to customers. Some products are stocked before and can be delivered to customers in a short time. To be able to supply products on company A well, it needs to have good supply warehouses for customers. Including warehouses in many provinces before shipping to customer addresses (districts, districts, wards). However, there are many costs that need to be optimized, such as the cost of storage and the cost of products supplied to the market, which is also an issue that needs to be calculated.
